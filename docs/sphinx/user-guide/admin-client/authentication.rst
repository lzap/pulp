Authentication
==============

This guide covers basic authentication and authorization in the Pulp Platform.

Layout
------

The root level ``auth`` section contains sub-sections to create and manage 
Pulp users, roles and their permissions for various resources. 

::

	$ pulp-admin auth
	Usage: pulp-admin auth [SUB_SECTION, ..] COMMAND
	Description: user, role and permission commands

	Available Sections:
  	permission - manage granting, revoking and listing permissions for resources
  	role       - manage user roles
  	user       - manage users

Users
-----

Pulp Server installation comes with one default user created with admin level privileges. 
Login and password for this user can be configured in ``/etc/pulp/server.conf`` at the time 
of installation. More users can be created to perform various administrative tasks. You can 
configure them with either admin level access or limited access to a few resources  
on the server.

::

	$ pulp-admin auth user --help
	Usage: pulp-admin user [SUB_SECTION, ..] COMMAND
	Description: manage users
	
	Available Commands:
	create - creates a user
  	delete - deletes a user
  	list   - lists summary of users registered to the Pulp server
  	search - search items while optionally specifying sort, limit, skip, and requested fields
  	update - changes metadata of an existing user

Here is an example of creating and updating a user:

::

	$ pulp-admin auth user create --login test-user
	Enter password for user [test-user] : 
	Re-enter password for user [test-user]: 
	User [test-user] successfully created

::

	$ pulp-admin auth user update --login test-user --name "Test User" -p
	Enter new password for user [test-user] : 
	Re-enter new password for user [test-user]: 
	User [test-user] successfully updated

If you intend to update password for a user, you can either pass it on the command line
with ``--password`` argument or use ``-p`` flag as shown in the example above to be prompted 
for a new password.

``user list`` command lists summary of all users. It also accepts arguments to list 
all the details or specific fields for users.

::

	$ pulp-admin auth user list --details
	+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
        	                         Users
	+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

	Login:  admin
	Name:   admin
	Roles:  super-users


	Login:  test-user
	Name:   test-user
	Roles:  
	
::
	
	$ pulp-admin auth user list --fields roles
	+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    	                             Users
	+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

	Login:  admin
	Roles:  super-users


	Login:  test-user
	Roles:  
	

Users can be removed from the Pulp server using ``user delete`` command. 

::

     $ pulp-admin auth user delete --login test-user
	User [test-user] successfully deleted
	
Users belonging to ``super-users`` role can be deleted as well, as long as there is at least one such user 
remaining in the system.

::

	$ pulp-admin auth user delete --login admin
	The server indicated one or more values were incorrect. The server provided the
	following error message:

   	The last superuser [admin] cannot be deleted

	More information can be found in the client log file ~/.pulp/admin.log.

Permissions
-----------

Permissions to various resources can be accessed or manipulated using ``pulp-admin auth permission`` 
commands. There are 5 types of permissions - CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE and EXECUTE. Permissions are
granted and revoked from a resource which is essentially a REST API path. 

Here are a few examples of accessing and manipulation permissions:

::
    
    $ pulp-admin auth permission list --resource /
	+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    	                       Permissions for /
	+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

	Admin:  CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE
	

Following command will give permissions to create, read and update repositories to ``test-user``.

::

	$ pulp-admin auth permission grant --resource /repositories --login test-user -o create -o update -o read
	Permissions [/repositories : ['CREATE', 'UPDATE', 'READ']] successfully granted
	to user [test-user]
	
::

	$ pulp-admin auth permission list --resource /repositories
	+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    	                 Permissions for /repositories
	+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

	Test-user:  CREATE, UPDATE, READ

Following command will revoke permissions to create and update repositories from ``test-user``.
	
::

	$ pulp-admin auth permission revoke --resource /repositories --login test-user -o create -o update
	Permissions [/repositories : ['CREATE', 'UPDATE']] successfully revoked from
	user [test-user]
	

Roles
-----

In order to efficiently administer permissions, Pulp uses the notion of roles to enable an administrator 
to grant and revoke permission on a resource to a group of users instead of individually. ``pulp-admin auth role`` 
command provides the ability to list the currently defined roles, create/delete roles, and manage user membership 
in a role. Pulp installation comes with a default `super-users` role with admin level privileges and the default 
admin user belongs to this role.

The ``role list`` command is used to list the current roles. 

::

   $ pulp-admin auth role list
	+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                 	Roles
	+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

	Id:     super-users
	Users:  admin

::

	$ pulp-admin auth role create --role-id consumer-admin
	Role [consumer-admin] successfully created
	
::

	$ pulp-admin auth role delete --role-id consumer-admin
	Role [consumer-admin] successfully deleted
	

Basic authentication of users
-----------------------------

All pulp-admin commands accept username and password to capture authentication credentials. 

::

    $ pulp-admin --help
	Usage: pulp-admin [options]

	Options:
  	-h, --help	            show this help message and exit
  	-u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME
    	                    credentials for the Pulp server; if specified will
        	                bypass the stored certificate
  	-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
    	                    credentials for the Pulp server; must be specified
        	                with --username
  	--debug	        	    enables debug logging
  	--config=CONFIG	        absolute path to the configuration file
    --map                   prints a map of the CLI sections and commands

Below is an example of basic authentication of users based on their username and password when 
running a pulp-admin command.

::

	$ pulp-admin -u admin -p admin repo list

Note that the username and password are passed to the ``pulp-admin`` command and not the sub-command, 
like ``repo list`` in this case.

Rather than specifying the credentials on each call to pulp-admin, a user can log in to the Pulp server. 
Logging in stores a user credentials certificate at ``~/.pulp/user-cert.pem``. 

::

    $ pulp-admin login -u admin
    Enter password:
    Successfully logged in. Session certificate will expire at Dec  6 21:47:33 2012
    GMT.

 Subsequent commands to pulp-admin will no longer require the username-password arguments 
 and will instead use the user certificate. User can be logged out by using ``pulp-admin logout`` command.

::

    $ pulp-admin logout
    Session certificate successfully removed.
